        <h1>About me</h1>
		<p>My name is Isaac Moorman and I'm from Boulder, Colorado. I'm an undergraduate math major in my senior year at St. John's University in Queens, NY, who is planning to study statistics in grad school. Outside of doing math, I spend what free time I have hiking and watching sports. ![](/assets/hiking.png)</a></p>
